# Community-built themes for Beeper Desktop
Beeper Desktop is fully customizable. You can use custom CSS to give Beeper Desktop a personalized look. If you build a nice theme, consider submitted a pull request to this repo to share it with other Beeper users!

We are currently rebuilding a large portion of the Beeper Desktop app. In the meantime, themes may not be fully supported, and new theme variables may be volatile between updates.
Any themes written before ~March 2024 will likely not appear correctly.


### How to use themes
1. Click [Themes](https://github.com/beeper/themes/tree/main/themes) -> select the theme you would like to try 
2. Select the text content and copy. This code is called CSS.
3. Open Beeper Desktop -> Settings -> Appearance 
4. Paste what you copied earlier into the box and hit `Apply`

*Please note:* Custom themes may cause problems visually with Beeper. We have not tested any of the themes on this site. If you encounter issues with a theme, please disable it by deleting the text from Settings -> Appearance and clicking `Apply`.


### How to submit a new theme

Create a Pull Request to this repro with the CSS file, screenshot and short description.
View [variables.scss](https://github.com/beeper/themes/tree/main/variables.scss) for all default values.
